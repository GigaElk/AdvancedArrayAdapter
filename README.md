# AdvancedArrayAdapter
Based on Androids array adapter, this adapter (will allow) more flexibility and functionality.

# Note
At this time, first push, the adapter only allows for substring filters (as opposed to ArrayAdapters "starts with" filter).
Not impressive I know, but as time goes on I will adapt this for further needs as they arise in my projects.
I post so other people may use this easily without spending hours on google figuring out how.

# Current Features
* Filters based on substrings, rather than from the start of the string.

# Disclaimer
